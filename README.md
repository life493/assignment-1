ASSIGMENT 1(TASK-1 AND TASK-2)
TASK-1(doing basic mathematical operation with two numbers):
Explanation and functionality of the code-
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME-The following python programme takes two numbers from the user and perfoms basic mathematical operation like addition , subtraction,multiplication and division
STEP 1-TAKING INPUT FROM THE USER
num1=int(input("Enter the first number":)) 
num2=int(input("Enter the second number":))
Here, the input function takes the input from the user 
num1 and num2 are the two numbers entered by the user
'int'converts the input to integer

STEP 2- PERFROMING BASIC MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS
Now in the second step, we performed the basic mathematical operations like addition,subtraction ,multiplication and division

STEP 3- PRINTING THE RESULT
In the last step after performing all the operations we will print the results.

TASK 2 (Creating personalized greeting ):
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME-The following pyhton programme takes the first name and last name of the user and combines them and prints a personlaized greeting message for them.

STEP 1-TAKING FIRST AND LAST NAME OF THE USER
Our first step would be to take the first and last name from the user 
f_name=input("Enter the first name:")
l_name=input("Enter the last name:")
Here, we used input() built-in function which asks the user to enter their first ansd last name and then we store the written text in varibles f_name and l_namr respectively.

STEP 2-CONCATENATING FIRST AND LAST NAME
Now we will add the first and last name which will give us the full name of the user.
add=f_name+l_name 
Here we have used a variable 'add' to store the full name of the user.

STEP 3 -PRINTING THE GREETING MESSAGE 
In the last step we have printed the greeting message along with the full name 
print("Hello", add, "Welcome to the Python program. Hope you are having a good day!").

print() is used to display the output.
The message "Hello", the variable add, and the greeting message are printed together.
